        "The paper aims to present a study on three methods for building **Recursive Deterministic Perceptron (RDP)** neural networks: **Batch**, **Incremental**, and **Modular** methods. The focus is on testing these methods' effectiveness in terms of **convergence time**, **generalization**, and **topology size** when applied to classification problems.\n",

        "1. **RDP Neural Network**: A generalization of the single-layer perceptron that can solve any two-class classification problem, including those involving non-linearly separable (NLS) data.\n",
